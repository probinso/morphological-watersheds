 abstract = {Visual cues are important to sea turtle hatchlings in determining seaward direction upon emerging from the nest. In this study, we examined the roles that color and intensity play in the sea-finding mechanisms employed by loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green turtle (Chelonia mydas) hatchlings. We tested hatchling preference for a standard source of constant intensity and color (1.26× 1015 photons s-1 m-2 at 520 nm), versus an adjustable light source (one of five monochromatic colors at each of seven photon intensities), using a two-choice apparatus. Both species oriented toward near-ultraviolet (360 nm), violet (400 nm), and blue-green (500 nm) light but chose the standard light source over yellow-orange (600 nm) and red (700 nm) light. There was a positive relationship between intensity and preference with 360, 400, and 500 nm light. We also examined hatchling choice of either a darkened window or a window lighted by one of eight monochromatic colors at each of two intensities. In these experiments, loggerheads oriented toward 360, 400, and 500 nm light but away from light in the green-yellow to yellow-orange range (560, 580, and 600 nm). Loggerheads oriented toward 700 nm light only at high intensity. Green turtles responded insignificantly to 600 or 700 nm light at either intensity. The contrast of green turtle behavioral responses with published electrophysiological data and the aversion to yellow light observed in loggerheads suggest some level of spectral quality assessment in sea finding for both species.},

        abstract = {We were interested in comparing the characteristics of polarization sensitivity in Atlantic salmon to those in Pacific salmon. Here we show that the common ancestor to the clade containing Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus mykiss, O. nerka, O. clarkii and Salvelinus fontinalis has the trait of ultraviolet polarization sensitivity. We examined spectral and polarization sensitivity of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) using both optic nerve compound action potential (CAP) and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Our experiments employed photic manipulation to adjust the sensitivity of the four cone mechanisms of Atlantic salmon. A spectrally broad background was used to ensure a contribution of all cone mechanisms to both spectral and polarization sensitivity. Chromatic adaptation was used to isolate the sensitivity of each of the four cone mechanisms for both spectral and polarization sensitivity. Under spectrally broad conditions, UV sensitive (UVS), mid wavelength sensitive (MWS) and long wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone mechanisms contributed to polarization sensitivity. CAP recordings produced the typical {\textquoteleft}W{\textquoteright} shaped polarization sensitivity curve reflecting two active polarization detectors with peaks at e-vector orientations of 0 deg, 90 deg and 180 deg, and troughs at 30 deg and 150 deg. ERG recordings produced a four-peaked polarization sensitivity curve reflecting two active polarization detectors and negative feedback activity, with peaks at e-vectors 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg, 135 deg and 180 deg, and troughs at 30 deg, 60 deg, 120 deg and 150 deg. Polarization-sensitivity measurements of isolated cone mechanisms revealed two orthogonal polarization detector mechanisms in Atlantic salmon, identical to that found in rainbow trout and other Pacific salmonid fishes. Moreover, under spectrally broad background conditions, CAP and ERG polarization sensitivity of Atlantic salmon did not differ significantly from that reported in Pacific salmonids.
